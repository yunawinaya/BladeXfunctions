We are going to create Picking Plan, it's basically really similar like GD but with couple of adjustment. So we inherit GD codes and tweak some of them. Thing that I could think of right now: 
- No Credit Limit,
- Multiple customers instead of 1 same customer from SO,
- No address related from customer since we are storing multiple customers, 
- No relation with Sales Invoice and Sales Return

customer_name will be an array, because we are able to store multiple SOs even with different customers

table name will be picking_plan instead of goods_delivery, and for prefix document_types will be Transfer Order. But when we tried to fetch picking_setup, movement_type will still be Good Delivery

Changed (changed means we change the name of the value in the db to match transfer order picking or to, since we inherit all the codes from gd so we have to change it):
gd_status -> to_status
gd_no -> to_no
gd_delivery_method -> to_delivery_method
delivery_date -> to_date
gd_created_by -> to_created_by
gd_dockey -> to_dockey
gd_ref_doc -> to_ref_doc
table_gd -> table_to
table_gd.gd_order_quantity -> table_to.to_order_quantity
table_gd.gd_order_uom_id -> table_to.to_order_uom_id
table_gd.gd_delivered_qty -> table_to.to_delivered_qty
table_gd.good_delivery_uom_id -> table_to.to_uom_id
table_gd.gd_undelivered_qty -> table_to.to_undelivered_qty
table_gd.gd_delivery_qty -> table_to.to_delivery_qty
table_gd.gd_qty -> table_to.to_qty
table_gd.gd_uom_id -> table_to.to_uom_id
table_gd.gd_initial_delivered_qty -> table_to.to_initial_delivered_qty
