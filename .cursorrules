## Current Task: Update Stock Movement item_balance handling - COMPLETED

### Problem Analysis:

- Stock Movement (SMsaveAsCompleted.js) had item_balance updates only for Miscellaneous Receipt
- Other movement types that add/subtract inventory were missing item_balance aggregation updates
- For serialized items: only updated item_serial_balance but not item_balance (aggregated)
- For batch items: only updated item_batch_balance but not item_balance (aggregated across batches)
- This was causing inconsistency in the aggregated balance data across the system

### Solution Implemented:

[X] **CRITICAL FIX**: Extended existing item_balance update logic to handle ALL movement types
[X] **DEDUCTION MOVEMENTS**: Added item_balance updates for Location Transfer, Miscellaneous Issue, Disposal/Scrap
[X] **ADDITION MOVEMENTS**: Added item_balance updates for Inter Operation Facility Transfer (already had Miscellaneous Receipt)
[X] **CATEGORY TRANSFER**: Added special handling for Inventory Category Transfer Posting (moves between categories)
[X] **SERIALIZED ITEMS**: Extended logic to handle serialized items that need item_balance aggregation
[X] **ENHANCED LOGGING**: Added detailed logging for all movement types in item_balance updates

**ADDITIONAL COMPREHENSIVE FIXES:**

[X] **updateReceivingLocation**: Fixed Location Transfer destination location to update aggregated item_balance
[X] **updateIssuingBalance (InProgress)**: Fixed Stock Movement InProgress to update aggregated item_balance for batched items
[X] **updateIssuingBalance (Receive)**: Fixed Inter Operation Facility Transfer issuing balance to update aggregated item_balance
[X] **updateReceivingBalance (Receive)**: Fixed Inter Operation Facility Transfer receiving balance to update aggregated item_balance

### Details:

**Movement Types Handled:**

_Deduction Movements (-):_

- Location Transfer: Subtracts from source location, adds to destination location
- Miscellaneous Issue: Subtracts from inventory
- Disposal/Scrap: Subtracts from inventory

_Addition Movements (+):_

- Inter Operation Facility Transfer: Adds to inventory
- Miscellaneous Receipt: Adds to inventory (already implemented)

_Special Cases:_

- Inventory Category Transfer Posting: Moves quantities between categories (no net change)

**For Serialized Items:**

- Extended condition to include serialized items that need aggregation
- Uses existing calculateAggregatedSerialQuantities function
- Updates item_balance for aggregated quantities across all serials

**For Batch Items:**

- Updates item_batch_balance for specific batch quantities
- Also updates item_balance for aggregated quantities across all batches
- Applies movement-type-specific logic (addition vs subtraction)

**Consistency:**

- Now maintains complete inventory tracking across specific and aggregated balance tables
- Ensures data integrity for both individual and consolidated reporting
- Handles all Stock Movement types consistently

## Previous Completed Task: Update PRTsaveAsCompleted.js item_balance handling - COMPLETED

### Problem Analysis:

- Purchase Return (PRTsaveAsCompleted.js) was missing item_balance updates for both serialized and batch items
- For serialized items: only updated item_serial_balance (individual) but not item_balance (aggregated)
- For batch items: only updated item_batch_balance (specific batch) but not item_balance (aggregated across batches)
- This was causing inconsistency in the aggregated balance data across the system

### Solution Implemented:

[X] **CRITICAL FIX**: Updated PRTsaveAsCompleted.js to include item_balance updates for serialized items
[X] **SERIALIZED ITEMS**: Added item_balance update logic for aggregated quantities (without batch_id)
[X] **BATCH ITEMS**: Added item_balance update logic for aggregated quantities across all batches
[X] **CONSISTENT LOGIC**: Ensures Purchase Return maintains consistency across all balance tables
[X] **ENHANCED LOGGING**: Added detailed logging for item_balance update operations

### Details:

**For Serialized Items:**

- Updates item_serial_balance changes (individual serial numbers)
- Also updates item_balance changes (aggregated quantities without batch_id)
- Groups by location for proper aggregation across multiple serial numbers
- Subtracts from unrestricted category (default for returns)

**For Batch Items:**

- Updates item_batch_balance changes (specific batch quantities)
- Also updates item_balance changes (aggregated across all batches)
- Applies category-based logic (Unrestricted, Quality Inspection, Blocked, In Transit)
- Uses actual categoryValue for proper quantity calculations

**Consistency:**

- Now matches the pattern established in Goods Delivery processes
- Ensures complete inventory tracking across specific and aggregated balance tables
- Maintains data integrity for both individual and consolidated reporting

## Previous Completed Task: Update GDcancelCreated.js item_balance handling - COMPLETED

### Problem Analysis:

- GDsaveAsCreated.js was updated to process item_balance for both regular and serialized items
- For serialized items: updates both item_serial_balance (individual) and item_balance (aggregated)
- For batch items: updates both item_batch_balance (specific batch) and item_balance (aggregated across batches)
- GDcancelCreated.js was missing the corresponding reversal logic for item_balance updates

### Solution Implemented:

[X] **CRITICAL FIX**: Updated GDcancelCreated.js to reverse item_balance changes for serialized items
[X] **SERIALIZED ITEMS**: Added item_balance reversal logic for aggregated quantities (without batch_id)
[X] **BATCH ITEMS**: Added item_balance reversal logic for aggregated quantities across all batches
[X] **CONSISTENT LOGIC**: Ensures cancellation properly reverses both specific and aggregated balance updates
[X] **ENHANCED LOGGING**: Added detailed logging for item_balance reversal operations

### Details:

**For Serialized Items:**

- Reverses item_serial_balance changes (individual serial numbers)
- Also reverses item_balance changes (aggregated quantities without batch_id)
- Uses quantity of 1 for serialized items as per business logic

**For Batch Items:**

- Reverses item_batch_balance changes (specific batch quantities)
- Also reverses item_balance changes (aggregated across all batches)
- Uses actual baseQty for proper quantity calculations

**Consistency:**

- Now matches the create/save logic in GDsaveAsCreated.js
- Ensures complete inventory reversal on cancellation
- Maintains data integrity across all balance tables

## Previous Completed Task: Fix Stock Movement balance_index append issue when editing drafts

### Problem Analysis:

- When saving a Stock Movement as Draft and then editing it again, the system was appending new entries to balance_index instead of updating existing ones
- The issue was in SMconfirmDialog.js where the filtering logic used strict equality (item.row_index !== rowIndex)
- Data type mismatch: existing entries had row_index as strings ("0", "1") while current rowIndex was a number (1)
- This caused "1" !== 1 to return true, so existing items were kept instead of being filtered out

### Solution Implemented:

[X] **CRITICAL FIX**: Fixed data type comparison in SMconfirmDialog.js filtering logic
[X] **STRING CONVERSION**: Convert both item.row_index and rowIndex to strings before comparison
[X] **PROPER FILTERING**: Now correctly removes existing entries for the current row before adding new ones
[X] **ENHANCED LOGGING**: Added clearer debug logging with quoted strings to show data types
[X] **DUPLICATE VALIDATION**: Added serial number duplicate validation in SMconfirmDialog.js to prevent same serial number from being allocated multiple times in the same location/batch combination

### Previous Completed Task: Fix costing method aggregation for multiple serialized items

### Problem Analysis:

- When processing multiple serialized items with the same material (e.g., MAT123 with SN001 and SN002), the WA/FIFO costing methods were only being updated once instead of aggregating the total quantity
- User reverted from aggregated approach back to individual processing, causing race conditions and incorrect costing updates
- Example scenario: Item #1 (MAT123, SN001, Qty:1) + Item #2 (MAT123, SN002, Qty:1) should deduct 2 total from WA/FIFO, but was only deducting 1

### Solution Implemented:

[X] **CRITICAL FIX**: Restored aggregated costing update approach to prevent race conditions and ensure correct totals
[X] **THREE-STEP PROCESSING**: Implemented proper separation of concerns:

- Step 1: Aggregate costing updates by material across all items
- Step 2: Apply aggregated costing updates once per material
- Step 3: Process individual balance updates and inventory movements
  [X] **NEW FUNCTION**: Created `processSerializedItemBalancesOnly` to handle balance updates without costing
  [X] **RACE CONDITION FIX**: Prevented multiple async processes from updating same WA/FIFO records simultaneously
  [X] **QUANTITY AGGREGATION**: Properly aggregates quantities from multiple items with same material before updating costing methods

### Previous Completed Task: Add duplicate serial number validation to Stock Adjustment

### Problem Analysis:

- Stock Adjustment (SAsaveAsCompleted.js) was missing validation to prevent users from processing 2 identical serialized items with the same serial numbers
- Users could accidentally select the same serial number for multiple items, leading to inventory inconsistencies
- Goods Delivery (GDsaveAsCompleted.js) already has this validation implemented
- Need to implement similar validation logic for Stock Adjustment

### Solution Implemented:

[X] **CRITICAL FIX**: Added `validateDuplicateSerialNumbers` function to prevent duplicate serial number processing
[X] **COMPREHENSIVE VALIDATION**: Implemented validation that checks for:

- Duplicate serial numbers across different items
- Excessive quantities (>1) for serialized items
- Non-integer quantities for serialized items
- Conflicting IN/OUT movements for non-serialized items at same location/batch/category
  [X] **DETAILED ERROR MESSAGES**: Added user-friendly error messages showing exactly which serial numbers are duplicated and in which items
  [X] **INTEGRATION**: Added validation call in `preCheckQuantitiesAndCosting` function before processing
  [X] **MAP-BASED TRACKING**: Used Map data structure to efficiently track serial number usage across all items

### Previous Completed Task: Fix Putaway split item serial number deduction

[X] **CRITICAL FIX**: Enhanced `calculateLeftoverSerialNumbers` function to handle split scenarios
[X] **SPLIT LOGIC**: Added logic to aggregate processed serial numbers from all child items for parent items
[X] **PARAMETER PASSING**: Updated function signature to accept `allItems` and `itemIndex` parameters for split handling
[X] **FORM UPDATES**: Enhanced form data updates to properly persist leftover serial numbers for both parent and child items
[X] **COMPREHENSIVE LOGGING**: Added detailed logging for split scenario debugging
[X] **PARENT COMPLETION FIX**: Fixed parent item serial number clearing when all child items are completed

### Fix Details:

**Enhanced calculateLeftoverSerialNumbers Function:**

- **Split Parent Items**: For parent items in split scenarios, collects all processed serial numbers from child items
- **Child Items**: For child items, uses their own `select_serial_number` array
- **Non-Split Items**: Maintains original behavior for standalone items
- **Aggregation Logic**: Properly aggregates serial numbers across multiple child items

**Split Scenario Handling:**

```javascript
if (item.parent_or_child === "Parent" && item.is_split === "Yes" && allItems) {
  // Collect all processed serial numbers from child items
  const childItems = allItems.filter(
    (childItem, childIndex) =>
      childItem.parent_index === itemIndex &&
      childItem.parent_or_child === "Child" &&
      childItem.item_code === item.item_code
  );

  // Aggregate all processed serial numbers from child items
  childItems.forEach((childItem) => {
    if (Array.isArray(childItem.select_serial_number)) {
      const childProcessedSerials = childItem.select_serial_number
        .map((sn) => sn.trim())
        .filter((sn) => sn !== "");

      allProcessedSerialNumbers = allProcessedSerialNumbers.concat(
        childProcessedSerials
      );
    }
  });
}
```

**Form Data Updates:**

- Updates `line_status` for all items (parent and child)
- Updates `pending_process_qty` for proper quantity tracking
- Updates `serial_numbers` for serialized items to reflect leftover serials
- Special handling for parent items in split scenarios to show correct leftover serial numbers

**Parent Item Completion Logic:**

- Added serial number handling in the parent item processing section
- When `parentPendingProcessQty === 0`, clears all serial numbers from parent item
- When `parentPendingProcessQty > 0`, calculates leftover serial numbers using child aggregation
- Ensures parent items show correct serial number state based on child completion status

### Example Split Scenario:

- **Original Serial Numbers**: `"SN001, SN002, SN003, SN004"`
- **Child 1 Processed**: `["SN001", "SN002"]`
- **Child 2 Processed**: `["SN003"]`
- **Parent Leftover**: `"SN004"`

The parent item will correctly show `SN004` as the leftover serial number after both child items have processed their respective serial numbers.

### Testing Required:

[X] Test split serialized items: verify parent serial numbers are correctly reduced by child processing
[X] Test multiple child items: verify aggregation works across multiple child items
[X] Test partial processing: verify leftover serial numbers are correctly calculated for split scenarios
[X] Test form persistence: verify leftover serial numbers are properly saved for both parent and child items
