## Current Task: Fix inventory dialog temp_qty_data missing location_id

### Problem Analysis:

- When opening inventory dialog after confirming selections, previous records are not correctly reflected
- The temp_qty_data JSON string is missing location_id field
- Example temp_qty_data: [{"material_id":"1959902300548952066","serial_number":"SN-0000000283","unrestricted_qty":1,"reserved_qty":0,"plant_id":"1123598813738675202","organization_id":"1123598813738675201","is_deleted":0,"gd_quantity":1}]
- Missing: location_id, batch_id (if applicable)

### Plan:

[X] Analyze GDconfirmDialog.js to see where temp_qty_data is created
[X] Identify missing fields in the stored data structure
[ ] Update the data structure to include location_id and other necessary fields
[ ] Test the fix

### Root Cause Found:

The temp_qty_data is created in GDconfirmDialog.js line 306 using JSON.stringify(filteredData). The filteredData comes from temporaryData which is from gd_item_balance.table_item_balance. However, the MAIN issue is that when users confirm the inventory dialog, the gd_qty field gets updated, which triggers GDgdQty.js. This code can overwrite the temp_qty_data that was carefully set by the inventory dialog, causing the loss of location_id and other critical fields.

### Analysis:

- temporaryData comes from data.gd_item_balance.table_item_balance (line 3)
- This should be the inventory balance data that includes location_id
- The example shows temp_qty_data missing location_id, batch_id
- Need to ensure the inventory dialog preserves all necessary fields when saving

### Solution Implemented:

[X] Added comprehensive debug logging to both GDconfirmDialog.js and GDinventoryDialog.js
[X] Enhanced the filteredData creation in GDconfirmDialog.js to ensure all required fields are preserved
[X] The fix ensures location_id, batch_id, and serial_number are always included in temp_qty_data
[X] **CRITICAL FIX**: Modified GDgdQty.js to preserve inventory dialog allocations instead of overwriting them

### Fix Details:

- Enhanced the data filtering process to preserve essential fields
- Added fallback field name mapping (location_id, locationId, bin_location_id)
- Added validation and warnings for missing critical fields
- **CRITICAL**: Added detection in GDgdQty.js to identify inventory dialog allocations (by checking for location_id)
- **CRITICAL**: Modified GDgdQty.js to preserve existing temp_qty_data when it comes from inventory dialog
- This ensures the mergeWithTempData function in GDinventoryDialog.js can properly match records

### Testing Required:

[ ] Test serialized items: confirm location_id and serial_number are preserved
[ ] Test batch items: confirm location_id and batch_id are preserved  
[ ] Test regular items: confirm location_id is preserved
[ ] Verify reopening dialog shows correct previous records
